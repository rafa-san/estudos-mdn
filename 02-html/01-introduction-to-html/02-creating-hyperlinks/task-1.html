        <h1>Task 1</h1>
        <p>In this task, we want you to help fill in the links on our Whales information page:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first link should be linked to a page called <code>whales.html</code>, which is in the same directory as the current page.</li>
          <li>We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.</li>
          <li>The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as <strong>"whales@example.com"</strong>.</li>
          <li>You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".</li>
        </ul>
